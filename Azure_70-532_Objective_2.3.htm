            A single Virtual Network (VNet) can span across multiple Azure Regions?

        <section class="description">
            False, Azure Virtual Networks are only supported for working within one region. To connect a Virtual Network across multiple Azure Regions requires you to connect multiple VNets together using a Site-to-Site VPN or VNet Peering.

            Do Virtual Networks (VNets) support IPv6?
        </section>
        <section class="answer">Yes</section>
        <section class="answer" data-correct>No</section>
        <section class="description">
            No. You cannot use IPv6 with VNets at this time. You can however, assign IPv6 addresses to Azure load balancers to load balance virtual machines.
